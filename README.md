# The Genomic and Immunogenetic Landscapes of DNA Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Neoplasia Delineates Shared Frameshift Neoantigens for Immunoprevention

## Project Overview
This repository contains the statistical analyses conducted as part of the study, Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific statistical analysis performed in the study.

## Folder Structure
Each repository folder which represent statistical is structured as follows:

- <Analysis Folder>: Represents a specific statistical analysis.
  - <Analysis>.R: The R script for performing the analysis. Simply run this script to load the input data and execute the analysis.
  - A processed data input file for reproducibility.

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results:

1. Open the desired analysis folder.
2. Run the corresponding .R script in R.
3. The script will automatically:
   - Load the associated input data file.
   - Perform all steps of the statistical analysis described in the study.
4. all scripts which represent an R analysis should be easily run on a standard desktop computer.
5. Tested on a Lenovo e15 with 16Gb of RAM and a 11th Gen Intel Core i7-1165G7 2.80GHz
