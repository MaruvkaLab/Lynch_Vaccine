# The Genomic and Immunogenetic Landscapes of DNA Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Neoplasia Delineates Shared Frameshift Neoantigens for Immunoprevention

## Project Overview
This repository contains the statistical analyses conducted as part of the study, Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific statistical analysis performed in the study.

## Folder Structure
Each repository folder which represent statistical is structured as follows:

## Analysis Folders
- Each folder represents a specific statistical analysis.
  - <Analysis>.R: The R script for performing the analysis. Run this script to load the input data and execute the analysis.
  - A processed data input file for reproducibility.

## Dependencies
- follow the instructions in the dependencies file

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results:

1. Open the desired analysis folder.
2. Open the .R file and validate that the input paths are linked to the desired files.
3. Run the corresponding .R script in R.
4. The script will:
   - Load the associated input data file.
   - Perform all steps of the statistical analysis described in the study.
5. all scripts that represent an R analysis should be easily run on a standard desktop/laptop computer.
6. Tested on a Lenovo e15 laptop with 16Gb of RAM and a 11th Gen Intel Core i7-1165G7 2.80GHz
